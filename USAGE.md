=============

Solvshift is a tool for calculation of solvatochromic frequency shifts using implicit and coarse-grained models. 
The following computations can be performed:
- Kirkwood-Onsager-Buckingham-Cho frequency shift calculations in *Rigid* and *Flexible* molecule approximations
- SolX-n solvatochromic parameters for selected mode
- Coarse-grained SolX-n frequency shift calculations
- Input files for all of these routines to create (Gaussian, Gamess or Coulomb)
