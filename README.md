The Solvshift (SLV) project is designed to
perform computations of frequency shift
of a solute immerged in a solvent in terms of discrete and
implicit solvatochromic models of prof. Minhaeng Cho and its extended versions.
Available models are:                                    
  * Kirkwood-Onsager continuum model                         
  * Discrete electrostatic SolX models and its arbitrary contractions.
    The SolX models available are SolDMA and SolMMM 

To see the help box and the options type
```
slv --help
```
To install the package you have to type:
```
sudo python setup.py install
```

The tutorial is under preparation.
