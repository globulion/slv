The Solvshift (SLV) project is designed to
perform computations of frequency shift
of a solute immerged in a solvent in terms of discrete and
implicit solvatochromic models of prof. Minhaeng Cho and its extended versions.
Available models are:
  * Discrete electrostatic SolX models and its arbitrary contractions.
    The SolX models available are SolDMTP[1] and SolMMM[2]
  * Kirkwood-Onsager continuum model

To see the help box and the options type
```
slv --help
```
To install the package you have to type:
```
sudo python setup.py install
```

The [tutorial](https://github.com/globulion/slv/edit/master/USAGE.md "Title") is under preparation. 

Good Luck!
