abstract  ={Systematic probing of local environments around biopolymers is important in understanding their functions. Therefore{,} there has been a growing interest in in-situ measurements of molecular granularity and heterogeneity through the systematic analysis of vibrational frequency shifts of carbonyl and nitrile infrared probes with vibrational Stark dipole theory. However{,} we here show that the nitrile vibrational frequency shift induced by its interaction with surrounding molecules cannot be solely described by electric field-based theory because of the exchange-repulsion and dispersion interaction contributions. Considering a variety of molecular environments ranging from bulk solutions to protein environments{,} we explore the distinct scenarios of solute-environment contacts and their traces in vibrational frequency shifts. We believe that the present work could provide a set of clues that could be potentially used to design a rigorous theoretical model linking vibrational solvatochromism and molecular topology in complex heterogeneous environments.}}

abstract = "The equation of state in the approximation of the second virial coefficient B is discussed theoretically for gases consisting of unlike multipolar molecules. A molecule of species i is assumed to posses a permanent 2n-pole moment M(n)i, as well as a 2n-pole moment P(n)i induced in it by the electric field F(n)i of order n of a neighbouring molecule of species j having the permanent 2m-pole electric moment M(m)j. Tensor formalism is used for deriving general expressions for the potential energy of electrostatic and inductional interaction of two multipolar molecules of species i and j. These energies then serve for computing two contributions to B: the one, of inductional type, is obtained in the first approximation and contains, in addition to terms with dipolar polarizability, terms accounting for the quadrupolar polarizability induced in the molecule by the molecular electric field gradient; the other, which is purely electrostatic, is obtained in the second approximation of the theory. Moreover, cross contributions to B between the electrostatic and inductional energies as well as contributions from dipolar anisotropy of dispersional-type interactions are computed. In computing the mean values of the respective powers of rij (the distance between the two molecules), a general Lennard-Jones (s-t)-type potential is applied. The theoretically derived non-central contributions to B are valid in general for molecules of arbitrary symmetry and arbitrary electrical structure; the expressions are applied to cases of axially symmetric, tetrahedral and octahedral molecules. For methane, the theoretical formulas allowed to determine numerically the octopole moment from experimental data on B to be ΩCH4 = 5 × 10−34 e.s.u. cm3. "

The sum of the two is much smaller than the polarization term, by up to an order of magnitude. The net contribution to hydrogen bond energies is a few kJ mol−1 at equilibrium and is approximately proportional to the exchange-repulsion energy at other geometries and no more than 10% of it in magnitude.

abstract  ="Two approaches for applying the Onsager-Kirkwood-Frohlich equation to liquid mixtures are revisited at the light of recent developments leading to the estimation of relative permittivities and refractive indices of thermodynamically ideal liquid mixtures. From the one-liquid approach{,} the squared permanent dipole moment of the mixture molecular-equivalent species M is demonstrated to be a mole-fraction average of squared permanent dipole moments of the components. An expression is obtained for calculating the ideal Kirkwood correlation factor of M at any composition by using only pure-constituent properties. From the two-liquid approach (Bottcher{'}s equation){,} equations are obtained to describe the dependence on composition of the Kirkwood correlation factor of both components in the ideal mixture{,} even in mixtures of Onsager liquids. This dependency is tentatively ascribed to London dispersion forces acting between unlike molecules. It is demonstrated that Bottcher{'}s equation can only be applied to mixtures where the relative permittivity of each component is larger than the squared refractive index of the other component. From the interplay of one- and two-liquid approaches{,} the ideal Kirkwood correlation factor of M and of both constituents are inter-related. Thermodynamic expressions are given for the calculation of excess Kirkwood correlation factors. In the case where permanent dipole moments are unknown{,} the ratio excess/ideal{,} termed the relative excess Kirkwood correlation factor for components and species M can still be evaluated. These ratios are related to more conventional excess properties. Density{,} relative permittivity and refractive index data are reported for binary mixtures of 2{,}2{,}2-trifluoroethanol with mono-{,} di-{,} tri- or tetra-glyme over the whole composition range at 288 K and 298 K. For these systems{,} ideal{,} excess and relative excess and Kirkwood correlation factors are calculated and discussed. In particular{,} by regarding Kirkwood correlation factors as a measure of order/molecular organisation in liquid mixtures{,} it is found that the formation of ideal mixtures entails a decrease of order which{,} for the present binary systems{,} is almost cancelled out upon passage to the corresponding real mixtures. It is concluded that the present formulation permits to estimate Kirkwood correlation factors of each constituent of liquid mixtures and thereby to draw information on their molecular organisation."}

abstract  ="Using a recently published benchmark MP2 database of nucleic acid base trimers{,} the three-body contribution to the interaction energy (TBE{,} also termed (non)cooperativity) as a function of base composition and complex geometry is studied. In 28 out of 141 cases (or 20%){,} the counterpoise-corrected MP2/TZV(2df{,}2pd) TBE exceeds 1 kcal mol-1. The TBE is below 1 kcal mol-1 for all trimers in the benchmark set consisting of U{,} T{,} and A{,} irrespective of the geometrical arrangement in the database. The largest MP2/TZV(2df{,}2pd) cooperativity of -9 kcal mol-1 is obtained for a hydrogen-bonded guanine trimer. The largest anti-cooperativity occurs for a protonated cytosine-guanine-cytosine trimer (6 kcal mol-1). Generally{,} the many-body non-additivity term is an order of magnitude smaller than the interaction energies (on average -33 kcal mol-1). Employing various density functionals (GGA{,} meta-GGA{,} and hybrid) and wave function methods up to third order perturbation theory{,} and using atomic-orbital basis sets of double-{,} triple-{,} and quadruple-[small zeta] quality{,} we find that the non-additivity effects are almost independent of one particle basis set and method. To enable an interpretation of the TBE{,} the intermolecular interaction energy is subjected to an energy decomposition analysis (EDA) with a similar definition of the energy terms as the Morokuma decomposition scheme. We find that nonadditive effects are mainly due to the induction{,} while exchange repulsion{,} electrostatic{,} and dispersion contributions are essentially additive{,} the latter also beyond second order at the MP3/SV(d{,}p) level. The performance of dispersion-corrected density functional theory for the prediction of structures and binding energies is assessed. While an accurate reproduction of the MP2-optimized reference structures of the trimers can already be accomplished with modern density functionals{,} only the inclusion of the long-range (London) dispersion interaction provides a consistent picture for both structures and binding energies."}

The contour changes resulting from methyl substitution and the consequent increase in asymmetry of the cis configuration proposed for N-methylformamide, are compared with those in the theoretical contours. As a first approximation, the rigid models for the four molecules are assumed to be valid at the temperatures used. Some of the gross structural features in the spectra are consistent with theory, but the results show the dangers inherent in the use of the theoretical contours as a basis for the detection of minor configurational differences in complex molecules.

Contrary to our vague expectation{,} the frequency shift is not well correlated to the hydrogen- or halogen-bond distance or strength{,} but nevertheless{,} it is well reproduced by an electrostatic interaction model if it is carefully constructed by considering the scalar and vector components separately in a reasonable way. On the basis of this electrostatic interaction model{,} the reason why our vague expectation is not realized is clarified{,} and a unified understanding is achieved on the hydration-induced high-frequency shift of the C[triple bond{,} length as m-dash]N stretch and the low-frequency shifts of the S[double bond{,} length as m-dash]O stretch and amide I[prime or minute]. With regard to the IR intensity{,} it is shown that{,} in some of the example cases{,} it also has rather strong angular position dependence.

However{,} the factors that influence the frequency of this vibrational mode are not understood. To determine these factors{,} herein we carried out linear and nonlinear infrared measurements on the C[triple bond{,} length as m-dash]N stretching vibration of the sidechain of 5-cyanotryptophan{,} 3-methyl-5-cyanoindole{,} in a series of protic and aprotic solvents. We found that while the C[triple bond{,} length as m-dash]N stretching frequencies obtained in these solvents do not correlate well with any individual Kamlet-Taft solvent parameter{,} i.e.{,} [small pi]* (polarizability){,} [small beta] (hydrogen bond accepting ability){,} and [small alpha] (hydrogen bond donating ability){,} they do however{,} collapse on a straight line when plotted against [sigma] = [small pi]* + [small beta] - [small alpha]. This linear relationship provides a firm indication that both specific interactions{,} i.e.{,} hydrogen-bonding interactions with the C[triple bond{,} length as m-dash]N (through [small alpha]) and indole N-H (through [small beta]) groups{,} and non-specific interactions with the molecule (through [small pi]*) work together to determine the C[triple bond{,} length as m-dash]N stretching frequency{,} thus laying a quantitative framework for applying 5-cyanotryptophan to investigate the microscopic environment of proteins in a site-specific manner. Furthermore{,} two-dimensional and pump-probe infrared measurements revealed that a significant portion ([similar]31\%) of the ground state bleach signal has a decay time constant of [similar]12.3 ps{,} due to an additional vibrational relaxation channel{,} making it possible to use 5-cyanotryptophan to probe dynamics occurring on a timescale on the order of tens of picoseconds."}

Steady-state and time-resolved infrared spectroscopy are performed on the model compound methylthiocyanate (MeSCN) in solvents of different polarity{,} and compared to data obtained on SCN as a local probe introduced as cyanylated cysteine in the protein bovine hemoglobin. The vibrational lifetime of the protein label is determined to be 37 ps{,} and its anharmonicity is observed to be lower than that of the model compound (which itself exhibits solvent-independent anharmonicity). The vibrational lifetime of MeSCN generally correlates with the solvent polarity{,} i.e. longer lifetimes in less polar solvents{,} with the longest lifetime being 158 ps. However{,} the capacity of the solvent to form hydrogen bonds complicates this simplified picture. The long lifetime of the SCN vibration is in contrast to commonly used azide labels or isotopically-labeled amide I and better suited to monitor structural rearrangements by 2D-IR spectroscopy. We present time-dependent 2D-IR data on the labeled protein which reveal an initially inhomogeneous structure around the CN oscillator. The distribution becomes homogeneous after 5 picoseconds so that spectral diffusion has effectively erased the {'}memory{'} of the CN stretching frequency. Therefore{,} the 2D-IR data of the label incorporated in hemoglobin demonstrate how SCN can be utilized to sense rearrangements in the local structure on a picosecond timescale."}

	abstract = {Enzymes use protein architecture to impose specific electrostatic fields onto their bound substrates, but the magnitude and catalytic effect of these electric fields have proven difficult to quantify with standard experimental approaches. Using vibrational Stark effect spectroscopy, we found that the active site of the enzyme ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) exerts an extremely large electric field onto the C=O chemical bond that undergoes a charge rearrangement in KSIs rate-determining step. Moreover, we found that the magnitude of the electric field exerted by the active site strongly correlates with the enzyme{\textquoteright}s catalytic rate enhancement, enabling us to quantify the fraction of the catalytic effect that is electrostatic in origin. The measurements described here may help explain the role of electrostatics in many other enzymes and biomolecular systems. Enzymes accelerate chemical processes by coaxing molecules into just the right reactive states. Fried et al. now elucidate the way the enzyme ketosteroid isomerase pushes its substrate toward product through exertion of a local electric field (see the Perspective by Hildebrandt). First the authors calibrated the shifts in molecular vibrational frequencies, known as Stark shifts, that fields of varying strength impose on a substrate analog; then they measured the vibrational spectrum of that compound in the enzyme{\textquoteright}s active site. The experiment uncovered an unusually strong field that the local enzyme structure directed to the precise spot where the substrate would react. Science, this issue p. 1510; see also p. 1456},

Good performance of B3LYP/6-31+G** is found for predicting vibrational frequencies in comparison with gas phase experimental data. The amide vibrational modes are assigned through potential energy distribution analysis (PED). The solvation effect on the amide vibrational modes is modeled within the PCM method. From gas phase to polar solvents, red shifts are observed for both harmonic and anharmonic vibrational frequency of amide I mode while the CO bond length increases upon the solvent polarity. Cubic and quartic force constants are further calculated to evaluate the origin of the anharmonicity for the amide I mode of NMA in different micro-environments. "

abstract = "A nitrile-derived amino acid, PheCN, has been used as an internal spectroscopic probe to study the binding of an inhalational anesthetic to a model membrane protein. The infrared spectra from experiment showed a blue-shift of the nitrile vibrational frequency in the presence of the anesthetic halothane. To interpret the infrared results and explore the nature of the interaction between halothane and the model protein, all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to probe the structural and dynamic properties of the protein in the presence and absence of one halothane molecule. The frequency shift analyzed from \{MD\} simulations agrees well with the experimental infrared results. Decomposition of the forces acting on the nitrile probes demonstrates an indirect impact on the probes from halothane, namely a change of the protein's electrostatic local environment around the probes induced by halothane. Although the halothane remains localized within the designed hydrophobic binding cavity, it undergoes a significant amount of translational and rotational motion, modulated by the interaction of the trifluorine end of halothane with backbone hydrogens of the residues forming the cavity. This dominant interaction between halothane and backbone hydrogens outweighs the direct interaction between halothane and the nitrile groups, making it a good “spectator” probe of the halothane-protein interaction. These \{MD\} simulations provide insight into action of anesthetic molecules on the model membrane protein and also support the further development of nitrile-labeled amino acids as spectroscopic probes within the designed binding cavity.

abstract  ="This paper presents an overview of recent experiments and theoretical developments aimed at using vibrational spectroscopy to understand the structure and dynamics of nitrile-labeled biomolecules. Nitrile groups are excellent vibrational probes of proteins and DNA because they absorb in a region of the spectrum that is relatively free of absorption due to the biomolecule{,} and they have high extinction coefficients. The vibrational frequency of nitrile groups is also extraordinarily sensitive to its local environment{,} and thus C[triple bond{,} length as m-dash]N bonds have been employed in both linear and 2-D infrared (IR) spectroscopy experiments and also as vibrational Stark probes of electric fields in proteins. The interpretation and design of these experiments would be enhanced by accurate calculations of IR spectra from molecular dynamics simulations. Recently{,} theoretical developments towards computing the vibrational spectrum of nitrile groups in the condensed-phase have been highly successful. A strong synergy between experiment and theory will further promote the use of vibrational spectroscopy of nitrile-labeled biomolecules to address fundamental questions of structure and dynamics that are elusive to other techniques."}

We consider the harmonic and anharmonic vibration of X–H in a variety of complexes and demonstrate that there is no fundamental difference between blue-shifting and red-shifting bonds.

A nitrile-containing inhibitor is used to deliver a unique probe vibration to the active site of human aldose reductase and the response of the nitrile stretch frequency is measured for a series of mutations in the enzyme active site. These shifts yield quantitative information on electric fields that can be directly compared with electrostatics calculations.

These shifts are in agreement with predictions from a model based on perturbation theory and involving the first and second derivatives of the interaction energy with respect to displacement of the ArH (FH) bond length from its equilibrium value in the monomer. In the FH⋯Rg dimers, small blue shifts were obtained for the He and Ne complexes and red shifts for those with Ar and Kr. In the FArH⋯Rg dimers, blue shifts were obtained for all four complexes. These vibrational characteristics are rationalized by considering the balance between the interaction energy derivatives obtained from the perturbative model. The bond length changes on complexation are also well predicted by the model. Our computations were restricted to the linear geometry since the objective was to investigate the validity of the perturbation model and to illuminate the causes of the red and blue shifts. "

abstract ={The introduction of chemically unique groups into proteins by
 means of non-natural amino acids has numerous applications in protein
 engineering and functional studies. One method to achieve this
 involves the utilization of a non-natural amino acid by the cell's
 native translational apparatus. Here we demonstrate that a methionine
 surrogate, azidohomoalanine, is activated by the methionyl-tRNA
 synthetase of Escherichia coli and replaces methionine
 in proteins expressed in methionine-depleted bacterial cultures. We
 further show that proteins containing azidohomoalanine can be
 selectively modified in the presence of other cellular proteins by
 means of Staudinger ligation with triarylphosphine reagents.
 Incorporation of azide-functionalized amino acids into proteins
 in vivo provides opportunities for protein modification
 under native conditions and selective labeling of proteins in the
 intracellular environment.},

However, in such works the determination of the limiting chemical shifts for the fully hydrogen-bonded state and for the non-hydrogen-bonded state is quite problematic, because they cannot be measured directly. In the present study, we carried out variable-temperature 1H NMR and IR measurements for N-methylacetamide in CDCl3 solution. We derived the expression for the limiting chemical shift for the fully hydrogen-bonded state as a function of IR band intensity and chemical shift. According to the equation, we determined the values of the limiting shifts at various temperatures. The present method may be applicable to other hydrogen-bonding systems. "

By treating U and the anharmonic terms in the potential energy function of the free molecule as small perturbations to the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian, the solvent shifts, $\Delta \omega $, in the vibrational frequencies are found to be proportional to (U$^{\prime \prime}$ - 3U$^{\prime}\scr{A}$/$\omega _{e}$), where U$^{\prime}$ and U$^{\prime \prime}$ are the first and second derivatives of U with respect to the normal co-ordinates and $\scr{A}$/$\omega _{e}$ is an anharmonic constant obtainable from the spectrum of the gas. The theory indicates that $\Delta \omega $/$\omega $ is independent of isotopic substitution as well as of the order of the transition; experimental data for HCl and DCl support these conclusions. The intensities of vibrational bands of dissolved molecules are shown to be proportional to a factor involving the refractive index of the solvent and to be dependent upon the derivatives with respect to the normal co-ordinates of the dipole moment of the solute molecule and its near neighbours. It is predicted that for diatomic molecules the intensity of the (n-1)th overtone, (A$_{s}$)$_{0,n}$, is related to the frequency $\omega $ so that (A$_{s}$)$_{0,n}$/$\omega ^{n+1}$ is independent of isotopic substitution, as in the gas phase.},

A quartic force field of NMA is constructed at the B3LYP/6-31G+(d) level of theory and its accuracy is checked by comparing the resulting anharmonic frequencies with available theoretical and experimental values. Quantum dynamics calculations for the amide I mode excitation clarify the dominant energy transfer pathways, which sensitively depend on the anharmonic couplings among vibrational modes. A ratio of the anharmonic coupling to the frequency mismatch is employed to predict and interpret the dominant energy flow pathways. "

abstract  ="Small IR probe molecules have been found to be useful to measure local electric fields in condensed phases and proteins and also to study nucleic acid and protein structure and dynamics by monitoring their vibrational couplings and frequency shifts. However{,} it is still difficult to accurately describe the vibrational solvatochromic frequency shifts of such IR probes{,} because the local electric fields produced by surrounding solvent molecules or by protein peptide and side groups are spatially non-uniform and highly inhomogeneous around a probe. We recently developed a distributed interaction site model to describe the vibrational solvatochromism and electrochromism of nitrile-{,} thiocyanato-{,} and azido-derivatized compounds and amino acids in solutions. Here{,} the nitrile or azido stretch is the maker mode. It was found that those interaction sites distributed over the IR probe molecule collectively act as an antenna sensing local electric field distributions around the IR probes. Once the vibrational solvatochromism of a given IR probe is understood{,} it becomes possible to quantitatively describe their vibrational Stark effects. Carrying out quantum chemistry calculations of cyanide{,} thiocyanate{,} and azide anions in water clusters{,} we extended the distributed site model for ionic IR probes and calculated the vibrational Stark tuning rates for direct comparisons with experimental results. It turns out that the charge transfers from an anionic solute to surrounding water molecules are significant{,} but their effects on vibrational solvatochromism and electrochromism of pseudohalide ionic IR probes are not. We anticipate that the present computational results will be of use to establish the relationship between vibrational frequency of an ionic IR probe and local electric field in condensed phases and protein matrices."}

By these means we obtain a unified approach to the derivatives at small extra computational cost to the energy calculation.

These relations make it possible to calculate all interaction double-tensor components through order L in an expansion in 1/R with computational expenditures that scale as L4. In contrast to Cartesian tensors, the orientation-dependent spherical double-tensors make it possible to evaluate electrostatic and induction energies with algorithms scaling as L4. By introducing an intermediate transformation to a special coordinate system the matrix of spherical interaction tensor elements can be factorized into a product of three sparse matrices, each of which can be calculated within L3 steps. We thus devise algorithms for the electrostatic, induction and dispersion energies that scale through order L in the multipole expansion as L3, L4 and L5, respectively. "

However, in such works the determination of the limiting chemical shifts for the fully hydrogen-bonded state and for the non-hydrogen-bonded state is quite problematic, because they cannot be measured directly. In the present study, we carried out variable-temperature 1H NMR and IR measurements for N-methylacetamide in CDCl3 solution. We derived the expression for the limiting chemical shift for the fully hydrogen-bonded state as a function of IR band intensity and chemical shift. According to the equation, we determined the values of the limiting shifts at various temperatures. The present method may be applicable to other hydrogen-bonding systems."

The energy lowering due to d functions is found to depend on the local symmetry around the heavy atom. For the particular basis used, the energy lowerings due to d functions for various environments around the heavy atom are tabulated. These bases are then applied to a set of molecules containing up to two heavy atoms to obtain their LCAO-MO-SCF energies. The mean absolute deviation between theory and experiment (where available) for heats of hydrogenation of closed shell species with two non-hydrogen atoms is 4 kcal/mole for the basis set with full polarization.

The method is applied to a molecular dynamics simulation of a liquid of 64 n-butane molecules and compared to a simulation using generalized coordinates.

abstract  ="The C[triple bond{,} length as m-dash]N stretching band () has been studied for dilute solutions of CHCN and (CH)CCN in a range of aprotic and protic solvents. The former induce a low-frequency shift{,} whereas the latter induce a high-frequency shift relative to dilute solutions in hexane. In both cases there is a large increase in oscillator strength with increasing shift. This is the first example of a solvent that has an absorption band displaying such a dichotomy{,} the normal behaviour being a progressive low-frequency shift on going aprotic to protic media. In contrast such {'}normal{'} behaviour is observed in the n.m.r. spectra for N shifts{,} but the C (CN) shifts are small and seem to be random. In contrast to our previous studies of {'}probe{'} molecules the bands for solutions in water are almost identical to one of the bands in methanol; however{,} the band in water is a single feature{,} whilst that in methanol is a doublet{,} the low-frequency feature being close to the unsolvated region. The interpretation is that MeCN in water is fully monosolvated (hydrogen-bonded){,} whilst in MeOH it is only 50% monosolvated. However{,} the effects of temperature changes and studies of mixed water-aprotic solvent systems suggest that this may not be correct{,} and the possibility that MeCN forms two very weak hydrogen bonds in water is also considered.The methanol doublets are well defined at low temperatures (-50 [degree]C) but resolution is lost on warming. At 50 [degree]C there is only one symmetrical band. For mixed water-aprotic solvent systems{,} the band remains a narrow singlet throughout the whole mole fraction range{,} there being no indication of twin bands for hydrogen-bonded and non-hydrogen-bonded units{,} in contrast with the results for methanol at low temperatures{,} and our normal experience with other probe molecules. One explanation is that there is rapid equilibrium between hydrogen-bonded and non-hydrogen-bonded units which is fast on the i.r. timescale. Results for other mixed-solvent systems are also reported.We have attempted to use changes in the first and second overtone O-H stretch bands for HOD in DO on adding MeCN to obtain a measure of the number of hydrogen bonds. This is at best only qualitative because of the proximity of the O-H band for solvated MeCN and the {'}(OH){'} band for water. However{,} for MeCN in MeCOH the (OH) and OH---(NCMe) bands are clearly resolved. The results support the concept that MeCN is dihydrated in water. A less extensive study has been made for 2-cyano-2-methylpropane (MeCCN) for comparative purposes. The results are broadly similar{,} the major difference being a reduction in the extent of hydrogen bonding in methanolic solutions."}

The spectra of these compounds in the gas phase have been systematically studied, in the mid- and far-infrared ranges. For each selected nitrile, the most intense vibration bands have been determined. Their strengths have been characterized by estimating the monochromatic absorption coefficient at the maximum(s) of the bands, and the integrated absorbance over the entire band. Then, in order to estimate the detectability of the selected compounds by infrared spectroscopy in the atmosphere of Titan, the data obtained have been extrapolated to the case of Titan."
