The contour changes resulting from methyl substitution and the consequent increase in asymmetry of the cis configuration proposed for N-methylformamide, are compared with those in the theoretical contours. As a first approximation, the rigid models for the four molecules are assumed to be valid at the temperatures used. Some of the gross structural features in the spectra are consistent with theory, but the results show the dangers inherent in the use of the theoretical contours as a basis for the detection of minor configurational differences in complex molecules.

abstract = { Infrared spectroscopy has played an instrumental role in the study of a wide variety of biological questions. However, in many cases, it is impossible or difficult to rely on the intrinsic vibrational modes of biological molecules of interest, such as proteins, to reveal structural and environmental information in a site-specific manner. To overcome this limitation, investigators have dedicated many recent efforts to the development and application of various extrinsic vibrational probes that can be incorporated into biological molecules and used to site-specifically interrogate their structural or environmental properties. In this review, we highlight recent advancements in this rapidly growing research area. }

title  ="C[triple bond{,} length as m-dash]N stretching vibration of 5-cyanotryptophan as an infrared probe of protein local environment: what determines its frequency?",

abstract  ="Recently it has been suggested that the C[triple bond{,} length as m-dash]N stretching vibration of a tryptophan analog{,} 5-cyanotryptophan{,} could be used as an infrared probe of the local environment{,} especially the hydration status{,} of tryptophan residues in proteins. However{,} the factors that influence the frequency of this vibrational mode are not understood. To determine these factors{,} herein we carried out linear and nonlinear infrared measurements on the C[triple bond{,} length as m-dash]N stretching vibration of the sidechain of 5-cyanotryptophan{,} 3-methyl-5-cyanoindole{,} in a series of protic and aprotic solvents. We found that while the C[triple bond{,} length as m-dash]N stretching frequencies obtained in these solvents do not correlate well with any individual Kamlet-Taft solvent parameter{,} i.e.{,} [small pi]* (polarizability){,} [small beta] (hydrogen bond accepting ability){,} and [small alpha] (hydrogen bond donating ability){,} they do however{,} collapse on a straight line when plotted against [sigma] = [small pi]* + [small beta] - [small alpha]. This linear relationship provides a firm indication that both specific interactions{,} i.e.{,} hydrogen-bonding interactions with the C[triple bond{,} length as m-dash]N (through [small alpha]) and indole N-H (through [small beta]) groups{,} and non-specific interactions with the molecule (through [small pi]*) work together to determine the C[triple bond{,} length as m-dash]N stretching frequency{,} thus laying a quantitative framework for applying 5-cyanotryptophan to investigate the microscopic environment of proteins in a site-specific manner. Furthermore{,} two-dimensional and pump-probe infrared measurements revealed that a significant portion ([similar]31\%) of the ground state bleach signal has a decay time constant of [similar]12.3 ps{,} due to an additional vibrational relaxation channel{,} making it possible to use 5-cyanotryptophan to probe dynamics occurring on a timescale on the order of tens of picoseconds."}

abstract  ="We investigated the characteristics of the thiocyanate (SCN) functional group as a probe of local structural dynamics for 2D-IR spectroscopy of proteins{,} exploiting the dependence of vibrational frequency on the environment of the label. Steady-state and time-resolved infrared spectroscopy are performed on the model compound methylthiocyanate (MeSCN) in solvents of different polarity{,} and compared to data obtained on SCN as a local probe introduced as cyanylated cysteine in the protein bovine hemoglobin. The vibrational lifetime of the protein label is determined to be 37 ps{,} and its anharmonicity is observed to be lower than that of the model compound (which itself exhibits solvent-independent anharmonicity). The vibrational lifetime of MeSCN generally correlates with the solvent polarity{,} i.e. longer lifetimes in less polar solvents{,} with the longest lifetime being 158 ps. However{,} the capacity of the solvent to form hydrogen bonds complicates this simplified picture. The long lifetime of the SCN vibration is in contrast to commonly used azide labels or isotopically-labeled amide I and better suited to monitor structural rearrangements by 2D-IR spectroscopy. We present time-dependent 2D-IR data on the labeled protein which reveal an initially inhomogeneous structure around the CN oscillator. The distribution becomes homogeneous after 5 picoseconds so that spectral diffusion has effectively erased the {'}memory{'} of the CN stretching frequency. Therefore{,} the 2D-IR data of the label incorporated in hemoglobin demonstrate how SCN can be utilized to sense rearrangements in the local structure on a picosecond timescale."}

	abstract = {Enzymes use protein architecture to impose specific electrostatic fields onto their bound substrates, but the magnitude and catalytic effect of these electric fields have proven difficult to quantify with standard experimental approaches. Using vibrational Stark effect spectroscopy, we found that the active site of the enzyme ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) exerts an extremely large electric field onto the C=O chemical bond that undergoes a charge rearrangement in KSI{\textquoteright}s rate-determining step. Moreover, we found that the magnitude of the electric field exerted by the active site strongly correlates with the enzyme{\textquoteright}s catalytic rate enhancement, enabling us to quantify the fraction of the catalytic effect that is electrostatic in origin. The measurements described here may help explain the role of electrostatics in many other enzymes and biomolecular systems. Enzymes accelerate chemical processes by coaxing molecules into just the right reactive states. Fried et al. now elucidate the way the enzyme ketosteroid isomerase pushes its substrate toward product through exertion of a local electric field (see the Perspective by Hildebrandt). First the authors calibrated the shifts in molecular vibrational frequencies, known as Stark shifts, that fields of varying strength impose on a substrate analog; then they measured the vibrational spectrum of that compound in the enzyme{\textquoteright}s active site. The experiment uncovered an unusually strong field that the local enzyme structure directed to the precise spot where the substrate would react. Science, this issue p. 1510; see also p. 1456},

The 3N-6 normal mode frequencies, diagonal and off-diagonal anharmonicities are evaluated by means of the second order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2). Good performance of B3LYP/6-31+G** is found for predicting vibrational frequencies in comparison with gas phase experimental data. The amide vibrational modes are assigned through potential energy distribution analysis (PED). The solvation effect on the amide vibrational modes is modeled within the \{PCM\} method. From gas phase to polar solvents, red shifts are observed for both harmonic and anharmonic vibrational frequency of amide I mode while the \{CO\} bond length increases upon the solvent polarity. Cubic and quartic force constants are further calculated to evaluate the origin of the anharmonicity for the amide I mode of \{NMA\} in different micro-environments. "

We present a vibrational spectroscopy technique that measures changes in electric field at a specific site of a protein as shifts in frequency (Stark shifts) of a calibrated nitrile vibration. A nitrile-containing inhibitor is used to deliver a unique probe vibration to the active site of human aldose reductase, and the response of the nitrile stretch frequency is measured for a series of mutations in the enzyme active site. These shifts yield quantitative information on electric fields that can be directly compared with electrostatics calculations. We show that extensive molecular dynamics simulations and ensemble averaging are required to reproduce the observed changes in field.},

 means of non-natural amino acids has numerous applications in protein
 engineering and functional studies. One method to achieve this
 involves the utilization of a non-natural amino acid by the cell's
 native translational apparatus. Here we demonstrate that a methionine
 surrogate, azidohomoalanine, is activated by the methionyl-tRNA
 synthetase of Escherichia coli and replaces methionine
 in proteins expressed in methionine-depleted bacterial cultures. We
 further show that proteins containing azidohomoalanine can be
 selectively modified in the presence of other cellular proteins by
 means of Staudinger ligation with triarylphosphine reagents.
 Incorporation of azide-functionalized amino acids into proteins
 in vivo provides opportunities for protein modification
 under native conditions and selective labeling of proteins in the
 intracellular environment.},

However, in such works the determination of the limiting chemical shifts for the fully hydrogen-bonded state and for the non-hydrogen-bonded state is quite problematic, because they cannot be measured directly. In the present study, we carried out variable-temperature 1H \{NMR\} and \{IR\} measurements for N-methylacetamide in \{CDCl3\} solution. We derived the expression for the limiting chemical shift for the fully hydrogen-bonded state as a function of \{IR\} band intensity and chemical shift. According to the equation, we determined the values of the limiting shifts at various temperatures. The present method may be applicable to other hydrogen-bonding systems. "

	abstract = {The effects of solute-solvent interactions on the vibrational spectrum of a dissolved molecule are evaluated by supposing that the interaction energy U can be expanded as a power series in the normal co-ordinates of the active molecule. By treating U and the anharmonic terms in the potential energy function of the free molecule as small perturbations to the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian, the solvent shifts, $\Delta \omega $, in the vibrational frequencies are found to be proportional to (U$^{\prime \prime}$ - 3U$^{\prime}\scr{A}$/$\omega _{e}$), where U$^{\prime}$ and U$^{\prime \prime}$ are the first and second derivatives of U with respect to the normal co-ordinates and $\scr{A}$/$\omega _{e}$ is an anharmonic constant obtainable from the spectrum of the gas. The theory indicates that $\Delta \omega $/$\omega $ is independent of isotopic substitution as well as of the order of the transition; experimental data for HCl and DCl support these conclusions. The intensities of vibrational bands of dissolved molecules are shown to be proportional to a factor involving the refractive index of the solvent and to be dependent upon the derivatives with respect to the normal co-ordinates of the dipole moment of the solute molecule and its near neighbours. It is predicted that for diatomic molecules the intensity of the (n-1)th overtone, (A$_{s}$)$_{0,n}$, is related to the frequency $\omega $ so that (A$_{s}$)$_{0,n}$/$\omega ^{n+1}$ is independent of isotopic substitution, as in the gas phase.},

A quartic force field of \{NMA\} is constructed at the B3LYP/6-31G+(d) level of theory and its accuracy is checked by comparing the resulting anharmonic frequencies with available theoretical and experimental values. Quantum dynamics calculations for the amide I mode excitation clarify the dominant energy transfer pathways, which sensitively depend on the anharmonic couplings among vibrational modes. A ratio of the anharmonic coupling to the frequency mismatch is employed to predict and interpret the dominant energy flow pathways. "

abstract  ="Small IR probe molecules have been found to be useful to measure local electric fields in condensed phases and proteins and also to study nucleic acid and protein structure and dynamics by monitoring their vibrational couplings and frequency shifts. However{,} it is still difficult to accurately describe the vibrational solvatochromic frequency shifts of such IR probes{,} because the local electric fields produced by surrounding solvent molecules or by protein peptide and side groups are spatially non-uniform and highly inhomogeneous around a probe. We recently developed a distributed interaction site model to describe the vibrational solvatochromism and electrochromism of nitrile-{,} thiocyanato-{,} and azido-derivatized compounds and amino acids in solutions. Here{,} the nitrile or azido stretch is the maker mode. It was found that those interaction sites distributed over the IR probe molecule collectively act as an antenna sensing local electric field distributions around the IR probes. Once the vibrational solvatochromism of a given IR probe is understood{,} it becomes possible to quantitatively describe their vibrational Stark effects. Carrying out quantum chemistry calculations of cyanide{,} thiocyanate{,} and azide anions in water clusters{,} we extended the distributed site model for ionic IR probes and calculated the vibrational Stark tuning rates for direct comparisons with experimental results. It turns out that the charge transfers from an anionic solute to surrounding water molecules are significant{,} but their effects on vibrational solvatochromism and electrochromism of pseudohalide ionic IR probes are not. We anticipate that the present computational results will be of use to establish the relationship between vibrational frequency of an ionic IR probe and local electric field in condensed phases and protein matrices."}

We use spherical tensor techniques and an intermediate transformation to a quasi-internal coordinate system, proposed recently to obtain a factorization of the multipole interaction tensors. By these means we obtain a unified approach to the derivatives at small extra computational cost to the energy calculation. For the special case of an electrostatic interaction the computational cost scales for a system of N molecules through rank L in the multiple expansion as \{N2\} x O(L3) for both the energy and its derivatives.

These relations make it possible to calculate all interaction double-tensor components through order L in an expansion in 1/R with computational expenditures that scale as L4. In contrast to Cartesian tensors, the orientation-dependent spherical double-tensors make it possible to evaluate electrostatic and induction energies with algorithms scaling as L4. By introducing an intermediate transformation to a special coordinate system the matrix of spherical interaction tensor elements can be factorized into a product of three sparse matrices, each of which can be calculated within \{L3\} steps. We thus devise algorithms for the electrostatic, induction and dispersion energies that scale through order L in the multipole expansion as L3, \{L4\} and L5, respectively. "
