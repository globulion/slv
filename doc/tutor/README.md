INTRODUCTION
------------

The following small tutorial has the aim to introduce the reader into the basic use of **Solvshift** package.
If your dream is modelling the solvatochromic response of molecule immerged in solvent environment of other
molecules **this package is just for you!** Note that this software is a relatively fresh born tool and is still under 
current intensive work. Therefore, it has not been published.

For the time being, **Solvshift** is generally a tool for calculation of the solvatochromic vibrational frequency 
shifts using mostly **coarse-grained** [models]. 
In the future, the implementation of the solvatochromic interaction-induced transition dipole change,
simulation of 1D and 2D infrared spectra and general improvement of accuracy and performance 
are planned. See the [ToDo lists] for reference upon current development tasks.
