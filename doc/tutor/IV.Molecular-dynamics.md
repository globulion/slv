Vibrational Solvatochromism from Molecular Dynamics
===================================================

INTRODUCTION
------------

This section of the Mini-Tutorial describes how to use Solvshift
to analyze the molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory files. 

There are as for now two kinds of molecular systems containing
the IR probe that can be
analyzed by SLV with the aid of the MD trajectory as the source of
structures:

 - **Homogeneous systems**. This mostly refers to IR probes dissolved
   in solutions, such as MeSCN in water, chloroform or any mixture of solvents
   that produces homogeneous molecular environment around the IR reporter.

 - **Heterogeneous systems (proteins)**. In this case the IR probe is embedded
   within the polypeptide or protein framework.
