INTRODUCTION
------------

The following small tutorial has the aim to introduce the reader into the basic use of **Solvshift** package.
If your dream is modelling the solvatochromic response of molecule immerged in solvent environment of other
molecules **this package is just for you!** Note that this software is a relatively fresh born tool and is still under 
current intensive work. Therefore, it has not been published.

For the time being, **Solvshift** is generally a tool for calculation of the solvatochromic vibrational frequency 
shifts using mostly **coarse-grained** [models](https://github.com/globulion/slv/blob/master/README.md). 
In the future, the implementation of the solvatochromic interaction-induced transition dipole change,
simulation of 1D and 2D infrared spectra and general improvement of accuracy and performance 
are planned. See the [ToDo lists] for reference upon current development tasks.

INTERACTING WITH Solvshift
------------------------------

Solvshift can be used in many ways depending on what task is to be performed.


### Interacting through main executable.

In general, simple calculations and tasks can be specified by using the 
**Solvshift** main executable script, `slv`. 
To see the version information run:
```
slv
```
The command
```
slv --help
```
will result in help box with a detailed description of Solvshift functionalities and usage.
> Many of the options are now obsolete. This will be fixed in the future.

### Interacting through SLV tools.

Most of the basic steps in setting the calculations can be done by using utility scripts
that are stored in `util` directory. Below I list their names and function.

**Table 1. SLV utility scripts.** The overall tool name is constructed from `slv_[Object Name]`.

*******

Some of the above tools automatize work with SLV by the use of other tools. Therefore, not all 
of the tools are important for a standard use and most of them are for debugging or developing 
Solvshift. To see the usage of these tools run them without arguments or with `-h` option.
> The option parsing scheme is now implemented for only some of the tools whereas the rest
> rely on simple argument list from command line. This will be changed in the future to 
> unify the way of using the tools, including printing the usage information (with `-h` option).
