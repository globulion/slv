INTRODUCTION
------------

This section of the Mini-Tutorial describes the usage of SolEDS method
within Solvshift. SolEDS
aims in calculation of the vibrational frequency shifts in small systems
(up to few tens of atoms) which are in energy minimum. The method
requires constructing the, so called, **constrained cluster** which is a
model of a true energy minimum such that the internal coordinates within 
the solute molecule are identical to the ones in the gas phase. The constrained
cluster has to imitate the true energy minimum as close as possible.

Figure 1 shows the main principle of SolEDS. The gas phase solute structure
is depicted as 1, whereas the true energy minimum structure (fully energy optimized)
is depicted as 2. The constrained cluster is shown as number 3 in this figure.

> Therefore, it is recommended to always check the model constructed automatically

> Below, I list the features of a good constrained cluster:
>  1. The internal coordinates of solvent molecules with respect to the
>     solute atoms involved in the normal mode of interest are almost identical
>     to the true energy minimum
>  2. All the other solvent molecules that are not in the closest contact
>     with the solute normal mode atoms are placed around solute in almost exactly 
>     same way as in the true energy minimum.
